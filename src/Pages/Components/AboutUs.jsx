                Welcome to the Rishihood University Community Engagement website! Here, we bridge the gap between the university and the local community, fostering a culture of collaboration, learning, and mutual support. Our platform is designed to showcase and facilitate a variety of initiatives that connect students, faculty, and community members.

We are actively working with Kishora to support and empower its residents through educational programs, healthcare initiatives, and sustainable development projects. Our efforts aim to enhance the quality of life in Kishora while providing our students with invaluable real-world experience.
